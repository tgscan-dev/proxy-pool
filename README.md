# Proxy Pool üåê
Preview: https://proxy.tgscan.xyz

A simple, lightweight proxy pool implementation using Spring Boot. This project fetches free proxies from various sources, validates their availability and anonymity, and provides a simple API for accessing them.

## Features ‚ú®

You got it! Here's the updated feature list with the Java coroutines advantage:

## Features ‚ú®

* **Automatic Scraping and Validation:**  Continuously scrapes proxies from seed websites and checks their validity.
* **Anonymity Check:**  Determines if a proxy masks your IP address for enhanced privacy.
* **Geolocation:**  Identifies the country and city of the proxy exit node.
* **Performance Sorting:**  Sorts proxies by response time, allowing you to pick the fastest ones.
* **Flexible Proxy Extraction:**  Uses regex to extract proxies in various formats from websites or local files. Works seamlessly with plain text, HTML, and even JSON sources.
* **Easy Integration:**  Provides a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve a list of validated proxies.
* **Enhanced Performance with Java Coroutines:** Leverages the efficiency of Java coroutines for highly concurrent operations, resulting in faster proxy scraping and validation.
